Hi I'm Luvl√∏rn, and this is my personal website.
This website is where i'll include my portfolio, projects and other work I've made.
This website is where I'll tell a bit of my story, and thank the poeple that inspired me to keep going forward and doing what I do.

So I, consider this website as a Thank You project for all the people that made me push forward, and keep doing what I love doing.
This is me.

This website was made with the HTML5 UP template Dimension by @ajlkn

Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)
This is Dimension, a fun little one-pager with modal-ized (is that a word?) "pages"
and a cool depth effect (click on a menu item to see what I mean). Simple, fully
responsive, and kitted out with all the usual pre-styled elements you'd expect.
Hope you dig it :)
