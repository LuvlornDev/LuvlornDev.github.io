                    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
                    <p>I'm Santiago Barajas better known online as Luvlørn. This is a project I started when I was about 10 years old when I started experimenting with FL Studio, I went by the name "BRCK" back then. Since I was very young, I always had a passion for technology, programming and hacking, probably influenced by my strong videogame enthusiasm and artists like Alan Walker, Skrillex, K-391 and Marshmello. When I was in primary school, about in 1st grade, I met the wonders of coding thanks to my ITC teacher who noticed the spark between me and computers, gaming, and showed me everything that's behind every game, website, system, etc. These two factors began the building of this young loner boy and keeps going.. And proof of this is <a href="#work">what i've done</a> so far.</p>

					<h2>TRANSCRIPT</h2>
					<p>Personally, I think that even if a challenge seems impossible to survive, eventually a person will grow and move forward, but I didn't always think that, especially in the hardest years of my childhood where I had to deal with the cruelty of bullying and of those classmates from that time who just wanted to get in my way. Years where a kid can just think: "People are evil."... Just that, and nothing else. It's incredible how a single thought can lead a person to do such horrible things, you know? Things like thinking they are not enough, or isolating from the rest of the world, or even hurting themselves hoping to find something better on the other side. That was my case... And I found nothing else than even more pain and dissapointment. So I decided to take another route... I decided not to give up just yet. Suddenly I had a feeling that told me that my life was like an unfinished book with a great story to come, and I just couldn't put the pen down and close it just yet. Then that thought came to my mind: "Even if a challenge seems impossible to survive, eventually a person will grow and move forward." So I pushed forward, resisting and fighting back. Until eventually, everything ended. All those people that made my life harder everyday they suddenly went away. I found friends, that also chose to fight back. I found people that actually care about me. I found someone to dedicate my songs to. I found... life. I blindly followed that thought in my mind... And I guess it was true... That single thought led me to want to help more lost people that go through the same darkness I went through... With my music... Or listening to them and sharing a bit of my story too... So they can find light again, and have a new beginning. Incredible what a single thought, or a single idea can do... Right?</p>
